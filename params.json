Features include:\r\n\r\n - Multi-partite tensor manipulations\r\n - Quantum system modelling including qudits, circuits, spins, and cavities\r\n - Symbolic Lie algebra simplification for spin and cavity systems\r\n - Quantum channels in multiple representations\r\n - Numerical and symbolic simulators for open and closed quantum system evolution\r\n - An implementation of GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering including distortions\r\n - Perturbative expansion tools such as the Magnus series, the Zassenhaus formula, and matrix power series\r\n - Visualization functions for displaying matrices, quantum states, data etc.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nQuantumUtils officially requires Mathematica 10.0.0 or newer. Many features should still work with Mathematica 9, and further compatibility may be added in the future. Older versions of Mathematica are not supported.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nOnce this repository is cloned onto your computer, open the *Install.nb* notebook in Mathematica and follow instructions there (basically just *Evaluation -> Evaluate Notebook*).\r\n\r\nThe installation places and/or symlinks files in your *`$UserBaseDirectory`/Applications* folder. \r\n\r\n## Using QuantumUtils for Mathematica\r\n\r\nPackages from the QuantumUtils for Mathematica library can then be loaded by invoking the `Needs` function, for example:\r\n\r\n    Needs[\"QuantumChannel`\"];\r\n    \r\nAll packages provided by QuantumUtils for Mathematica can be loaded simultaneously by needsing QuantumUtils`:\r\n\r\n    Needs[\"QuantumUtils`\"]\r\n    \r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is stored as *.nb* notebooks in the *doc* folder. The documentation index can be opened from within Mathematica at any time by evaluating:\r\n\r\n    <<QUDoc`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, each function implemented by QuantumUtils should come with a `usage` tag. This tag can be displayed using the `?` symbol as with built-in functions:\r\n\r\n    ?EvalPulse\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-New%20BSD-blue.svg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause_license_.28.22Revised_BSD_License.22.2C_.22New_BSD_License.22.2C_or_.22Modified_BSD_License.22.29)\r\n\r\nYou are free to use this software, with or without modification, provided that the conditions listed in the LICENSE.txt file are satisfied.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
